          <h2>White Nights</h2>
          <p>Fyodor Dostoevsky's 1848 novella is a tender, melancholic romance set during St Petersburg's luminous summer nights. A lonely “dreamer” meets Nastenka, a young woman waiting for her lover's return, and over four successive evenings pours out his soul to her. Themes of isolation, idealised love and the gulf between dreams and reality make it an early gem of Dostoevsky's work.</p>
